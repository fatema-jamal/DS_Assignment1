Submission of the first assignment for Distributed System course


To run the distributed system above pleases take in consideration :

     1- After downloading and opening the three classes in the same project, run the main function of these classes in the  following sequence : 
         Sensor.java ---> Server.java ---> Computer.java
      
     2-After running the system correctly according to point 1 , and the console screen prints to you "How can i help you ?"
       , you have to write " Best Route" to make the code working properly 
       
  Knowing that most of functions that is responsible for taking readings from sensors or calculating the best route are dummy functions , as our target is 
  to connect the 3 tiers together and show the return of these functions is forwarded through the sockets and data streams we implemented in 
  this system .
